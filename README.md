## About The Project

<img src="./react-app/public/connectidLogo.png" width="200"/>

Connectid is a full stack web app, cloned from one of the largest music discovery platforms, SoundCloud. With Vibe Vapor you can check out other artists, try playlists and play music, all with keeping the same vibe as SoundCloud.

## Key Functionalities

- Users can sign up, login to begin using all the other features of Connectid
- After users are signed up and logged in, they can begin customizing their profile
- Users can create posts with attached images from their computer
- Users can interact with other users by liking or commenting on others' posts

## To do

- Allow more customizable features for users to display their talents and work across the platform, like an in-depth education display

- Add in a chatting feature using websockets to allow users to communicate with each other in real-time

- As more users, posts and features get added in, users need additional functionality to navigate the website easaier, while also keeping clutter to a minimum. A search feature as well as filtering would be beneficial
